# Phiki-web
The original phiki was written in python, it was also stored in a github codespace I deleted therefore removing all of the progress I had done. This time it'll be written (hopefully) in a mix of JS and HTML so that it is web compatible.
Problems with the old Phiki:
- You could not edit any file (this sucked because I was lazy I tried to justify it through ideas about truth but I was just being lazy)
- It was entirely written in one python file, not like awful but it should have been split up and worked into multiple places to create a nice look
- It was only usable in terminal. This was fine as I was using it for personal usage as a storage place but it was horrible to interact with. Porting it over to a web edition will make it nicer and more usable for people who are not me
- It did not have a front end or back end, if you ran the program you had total permission to do anything as an admin.
- It was written very very very badly from a ux perspective


I am passionate about this project, hence why I have come back to it to rewrite all of it in JS even after everything got lost.
This is not about really making the wiki anymore, it is more about making a project and this just is something I feel inclined to approach as a programmer.
Hopefully I don't get burnout as it is december so AOC is happening as I start this project but lets make a start.
